#Global cushion dataset
###Purpose
To explore the importance of cushion-forming plant species as foundation species in the alpine.

###Meta-data  
A set of data collected by ecologists globally at their respective alpine study sites. Sampling was structured using the dominant plant species at high-elevation meadows. The dominant lifeform used was cushion-forming, and association patterns of the local plant species with cushions relative to 'open' microsites were recorded.

###Data
```{r, data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

#data
data <- read_csv("data/global_cushion_community_data.csv")

#quick check
#library(devtools)
#devtools::install_github("hadley/colformat")
#devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/skimr")
library(skimr)
d <- skim(data)
d

meta.data <- read_csv("data/cushion_site_metadata.csv")
meta.data


```
